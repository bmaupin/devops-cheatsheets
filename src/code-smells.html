    <h3>Using timeout or sleep in code</h3>
    <p>
      Using pause/sleep/timeout in your code to get around timing issues. This
      is often a sign of a bigger problem in the code, perhaps a bug or race
      condition. Using sleep without understanding the root problem can
      introduce flaky behaviour in the code as well as race conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solution: Take the time to fully understand the problem to figure out
      what's causing the timing issue in the first place
    </p>

    <h3>Long parameter list</h3>
    <p>When a method takes more than 3 or 4 parameters</p>
    <p>
      Solution: Consider putting the parameters in an object and passing that
      object to the method
    </p>

    <h3>Sequential coupling (or temporal coupling)</h3>
    <p>
      A form of coupling where a class requires its methods to be called in a
      particular sequence (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_coupling"
        >source</a
      >)
    </p>
    <p>
      Solution: The key to sequence-type temporal coupling is making the
      sequences obvious or eliminating them completely. Make it easy to avoid
      getting it wrong. (<a
